# Case_Study
                                                  Business Objective 
To help X Education select most promising Leads( Hot Leads), the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers:
a)Selection of the hot leads
b)Focused marketing
c)Higher lead conversion rate
                                                 Goals of the Case Study
Build a logistic regression model with a score range of 0 to 100 for each lead so that the business can target potential leads. A greater score, on the other hand, would suggest that the lead is hot and likely to convert, while a lower number would indicate that the lead is cold and unlikely to convert.
